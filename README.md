<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
Here is an MVC Web App that allows the user to enter in policy information for a car insurance website. A quote is calculated based on the user's information and all the information is saved to a database. There is also an admin page that allows a staff member to view all the quotes.
<h3>Twenty One</h3>
This is a console application that allows the user to play a game of Black Jack at a fictional casino against a dealer. It utilizes many User-created Class objects. The game will track the user's bets and increase or decrease their bank as they win or lose. The program will store Exceptions encountered to a database.
