<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
Here is an MVC Web App that allows the user to enter in policy information for a car insurance website. A quote is calculated based on the user's information and utilizes Entity Framework to interact with a database. There is also an admin page that allows a staff member to view all the quotes.
<h3>Twenty One</h3>
This is a console application that allows the user to play a game of Black Jack at a fictional casino against a dealer. It utilizes many User-created Class objects. The game will track the user's bets and increase or decrease their bank as they win or lose. The program will store Exceptions encountered to a database.
<h3>Newsletter Signup</h3>
This is an MVC Web App that lets a user enter in their name and email address that simulates signing up for a newsletter. There is an admin page that displays the users that have signed up and includes an unsubscribe button that will remove them from the list while still saving their data in the database.
<h3>Tech Store Inventory</h3>
This MVC Web App allows a user to enter in a product that would belong in an Tech store and uses Entity Framework to store the product details in a database.
